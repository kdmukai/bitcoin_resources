# Bitcoin Resources
My starter pack for people new to the bewildering world of bitcoin.


## Guided Introduction
### "What is bitcoin?!"
This is a HUGE topic. It's best to break it down into a few important sub-categories:

* Why does bitcoin have value?
* How do I buy/sell/hold bitcoin?
* How does bitcoin work?

These are listed in this order for a reason.

In order to appreciate why Bitcoin matters, you have to understand what money is. Most of us have never had any reason to think deeply about the nature of money but once you start digging in, what you find will surprise you. People who don't understand our current fiat money system cannot appreciate Bitcoin.

Once you're intrigued the next step is to set up a Bitcoin wallet and then experience sending and receiving some bitcoin. Use bitcoin in order to start understanding the mechanisms of how it works.

Finally learn a bit about the technical aspects of Bitcoin. Why are everyone's transactions public? What is a private key? What are miners? _This is all the least important part for a noob!_ But too many people think they need to start with it. It's just too arcane and seemingly pointless unless you have the broader context provided above.


#### 1. Why does Bitcoin have value?
The real answer here starts with the flip side of the question: Bitcoin has value because our current fiat money system does not. The money that you've been used to your whole life is not a solid foundation to build upon; it's really more like quicksand, swallowing your wealth faster than most people can build it. So any deep discussion of Bitcoin's value is really 80% "What is fiat money?" and 20% "How does Bitcoin fix it?"

* [Robert Breedlove interview on Kitco News](https://youtu.be/Y_cViC7PSN0) (28 minutes). Ignore the click-baity title. Breedlove is a really deep thinker on Bitcoin and philosophy in general and does an amazing job explaining the problems of fiat money and why Bitcoin serves as a safe haven.

* When you're ready to invest a little more time into this endlessly fascinating area, start looking at the [Bitcoin books](#bitcoin-books) section below.


#### 2. How do I buy/sell/hold bitcoin?
Hopefully you have a Bitcoin-savvy friend you can reach out to. With that friend or on your own, walk through my [step-by-step beginner's guide](https://github.com/kdmukai/bitcoin_gift_guide) to setting up a wallet on your phone.

Then look at the [Exchanges](#exchanges) section below. You almost definitely want to start with one-off buys via Cash App to learn and then quickly transition to setting up small repeated buys via Swan.


#### 3. How does Bitcoin work?
* [3Blue1Brown: But how does Bitcoin actually work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&list=PLoF4_lt35vblXZz0YUK59X0RnV1V3OvkT&index=1): This is my favorite explainer so far. He does a great job of starting with a simple example of a group of friends who want to be able to pay each other in cash and analyze what solutions might work. But as he broadens out his example beyond just a tight circle of trusted friends, the problems get thornier and thornier. Each step of the way he's layering in solutions that are built into bitcoin to address those exact problems. In this way you don't just get the "how" it works, you really appreciate "why" each element is a crucial part of bitcoin.

    My only minor gripe is that he does get a little deeper into the math than I would have. But it isn't overwhelming. Stick with it. Rewatch it a few times. It's 1000% worth it.

* _Other good intro videos...?_

* [SciShow: Bitcoin: How Cryptocurrencies Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kubGCSj5y3k&list=PLoF4_lt35vblXZz0YUK59X0RnV1V3OvkT&index=2): This one is a distant second. The information is good and is more technical but it goes by WAY TOO FAST! Digest this in 20sec snippets. Pause and rewatch each section as needed. Go off and review other sources then come back to this one later to see if more of it is making sense.


## Resource List
### Podcasts
[What Bitcoin Did - Peter McCormack](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast):
[McCormack](https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack) is the best at playing the super-valuable "wait, I don't understand this" role for listeners who aren't technical and don't yet understand the complexities. All the major players in the bitcoin ecosystem end up on his show. Each new episode goes straight to the top of my queue.

[The Investors Podcast - Bitcoin Fundamentals (Preston Pysh)](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/):
This is a series within their unified podcast stream (their "We Study Billionaires" episodes are also a good listen). This is an excellent bridge for people who are already engaged in traditional markets. Be sure to follow [Preston](https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh) as well.

[Swan Signal](https://swansignalpodcast.com/):
Part of the education and marketing outreach for Swan Bitcoin. They put out excellent education content and have some of the strongest, most trusted bitcoiners on staff. Downside: each ep is just the audio from a live Zoom call so is often plagued by the typical glitches and cross-talk that happens on a livestream. Probably better to watch the [video version on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwanSignal).

[The Pomp Podcast - Anthony Pompliano](https://anthonypompliano.com/podcast/):
Pomp is a frequent CNBC guest and is insanely articulate. He understands bitcoin and can communicate with people who are deeply entrenched in the traditional financial system. He speaks their language.

[Stephan Livera Podcast](https://stephanlivera.com/):
Very technical but also focused on Austrian economics. Pick and choose the episodes that fit your interest/tech level.


### YouTube
[Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ): The absolute best at providing the sweeping, broad vision for how bitcoin can change the world for the better. If you want the big picture, his talks are phenomenal. I support him on Patreon.

But as much as I love him, I don't think he's quite right for beginners; you need a little more foundation before you can understand his inspiring extrapolations. Note that his Q&A vids can be super-technical.

[Swan Signal](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwanSignal): They post their interview segments here and run a 24/7 [BitcoinTV channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv3NTan7_Jc) that's basically a loop of their best content plus live cut-ins as they conduct new interviews. Some of their livestreams aren't much more than Zoom hangouts but their [more focused interviews and discussions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NlvWollN9M) are phenomenal.

[BlockWorks](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlockWorksGroup): I just recently started watching their streams and they've quickly become a favorite to watch during lunch breaks. They have great guests and solid discussions on the latest news.

### Bitcoin books
[Layered Money, by Nik Bhatia](https://www.amazon.com/Layered-Money-Dollars-Bitcoin-Currencies/dp/1736110527): A quick, efficient read that establishes a powerful "layers" metaphor for money that starts from an epoch of gold coin-based economy on up to the present day and beyond. This is currently my go-to book to refer to people who want to understand why bitcoin has any value.

To understand the possible significance of bitcoin you have to understand how many layers of money--and risk--sit between your US dollars and actual value. The primary focus here is to understand money first.

<details>
  <summary>caveats</summary>

  _The chapter on bitcoin is actually the weakest of the book. A bit too dry and too complex for someone totally new to bitcoin. There are better "what is bitcoin" explainers out there. Read the bitcoin chapter, but lean more heavily on other resources to get a better understanding of the basics._
</details>

[The Bitcoin Standard, by Saifedean Ammous](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861): A deeper dive into the history of money and how humanity has naturally selected the "best" form of money over time based on a variety of characteristics. Think of this as the advanced level course after Bhatia's quick introduction above. Saif's clear articulation of which properties a "good" money must have culminates in a strong endorsement of bitcoin as the best form of money we've ever seen.

<details>
  <summary>caveats</summary>

  _Saif indulges in some regrettable rants against fiat money--including a whole chapter where he claims that even art and food suffer in a fiat world--that I wish would have been edited out for being off-topic and more his opinion than anything I could see being rooted in fact or data. Unfortunately his overall goal is not to persuade the skeptical reader who is used to the fiat money world; he is more likely to ridicule and punish fiat defenders. I wish he would have taken a more welcoming approach but his anger and confrontational nature win out. And, as with Bhatia, I think his chapter on bitcoin towards the end is quite uninteresting and, to be honest, I can't recall if I even finished the book. He made the case in the 2/3rds of the book that analyze previous forms of money; the bitocin parts weren't telling me anything I didn't already know._
</details>

[Digital Gold, by Nathaniel Popper](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Gold-Bitcoin-Millionaires-Reinvent-ebook/dp/B01D8KFX9Q/): This is a fascinating, fun retelling of the early days of bitcoin with deep dives into all the crazy characters that helped make it happen. Save this book for when you're already deep down the rabbit hole. But once you are a die-hard bitcoiner, this is a must-read.


### Exchanges
[Cash App](https://cash.app/app/BCGVHBJ): Makes the most sense for someone that just wants to dabble once or twice with buying bitcoin. Fees are not great but it's fine if you're just playing. You can transfer the btc you buy out of Cash App and into a wallet that you control. This is an important difference between other similar services that don't allow you to withdraw (Robinhood, PayPal). Cash App pays the bitcoin network/miners' fees on your withdrawals. You can also use Cash App as a simple wallet to recieve bitcoin, though in the long run there are much better options.

[Swan Bitcoin](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/banzai): By far the best option for casual investors who want to automate as much as possible. Link your bank account and set an investment schedule (e.g. $10 every week) and it'll automatically do the buys for you. Fees depend on amount purchased per week, ranging from 1.19% to 2.29%. And because Swan is built by true bitcoiners, they encourage you to get your btc off of their platform. You can provide them with a receive address and set up autowithdrawals. They pay the bitcoin network fee on the withdrawal. You then have complete set-it-and-forget-it bitcoin buys that land safely in a wallet that you control!

[Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/share/v588gelc8): For more serious investors moving larger sums of money. At this level you need to really minimize fees and avoid the price spreads that the other services tack on to the price. Their normal website and app has a high fee structure. But if you change your account to use their "Activetrader" trading UI, you'll pay really minimal fees: currently 0.25% for "maker" orders and 0.35% for "taker" orders. Big bonus: Gemini withdrawals are free(?) up to a monthly limit.

Be warned: the _Activetrader_ UI is overwhelming and chaotic.

[Coinbase Pro](https://www.coinbase.com/join/mukai_os): Convenient low-fee option if you already have a [regular Coinbase account](https://www.coinbase.com/join/mukai_os). Use it to login at [pro.coinbase.com](https://pro.coinbase.com) to access their Pro UI. Trading on Coinbase Pro drops your total fees to a 0.5% flat fee (one $100 buy carries the same 50¢ fee that you'd end up paying for twenty $5 buys). Can do instant buys from your linked checking account with no additional fee up to $25k(!). Incoming wire transfers add a $10 fee (but once your bank account is linked, the instant buy feature makes wire transfers unnecessary). 

As with Gemini's pro platform, Coinbase Pro's UI is overwhelming. But all you need are market buys/sells. Withdrawals are charged to you but they do bulk transactions so the total fee is much lower than you'd pay for moving some bitcoin yourself.

Paxos / itBit: Matches Gemini for lowest possible fees, simpler UI. If you set a "post only" limit order, you only pay 0.25%. If you do an instant "market" order it's 0.35%. Paxos is built to cater to larger institutions so ACH transfers aren't encouraged (limited to $500/wk and have a crappy 1% fee). Incoming wire transfers have no fee and no limits. You pay a share of the bitcoin network/miners' fee to withdraw your btc.


### Bitcoin "wallets"
"Wallets" is a misnomer; they're really more like storehouses for your bitcoin private keys (which you can sort of think of as the password for your bitcoin funds).

[BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/): This is where I start all beginners. It's an open-source software wallet that lives on your phone or desktop app. Not the most secure option but is good enough and is better than leaving your coins on an exchange. see my [step-by-step beginner's guide](https://github.com/kdmukai/bitcoin_gift_guide).

Hardware wallets:
(this list is not exhaustive)
* Trezor
* Ledger
* Coldcard
* KeepKey
* various DIY projects: Specter DIY, SeedSigner


### Earning interest on bitcoin and USD stablecoins
Lending platforms offer interest on bitcoin in the 4.5-6.25% range and up to 12.5% on USD stablecoins (a crypto token where 1 USDC, PAX, TUSD, etc is "guaranteed" to be worth $1 regardless of how prices are swinging in the broader crypto markets). You take on some greater risk ("not your keys, not your bitcoin") but if you dig into each platform's risk management approach you might decide that the modest risk is well worth the huge interest payouts.

[BlockFi](https://blockfi.com/?ref=55312987): $15b under management as of March 2021. Pays interest on btc and USD deposits which are then lent out primarily via overcollateralized loans (to borrow $1000 USD you have to deposit at least $2000 worth of btc), which significantly reduces the risk to the lender. Some undercollateralized lending does happen (~20-50% of their loans) but only to a limited selection of institutional partners. The best bitcoin interest rate maxes out at 1.0 btc (deposits above that earn a greatly reduced rate).

This [podcast with CEO Zac Prince](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/btc013-bitcoin-lending-borrowing-w-blockfis-zac-prince-mark-yusko/) is a good starting point. The interviewer, Preston Pysh, asks really savvy, important questions about the risks.

[Ledn](https://platform.ledn.io/join/f28658694234fd0a38458952642f59d5): Best rate is currently capped at 2.0 btc. As with every platform they offer overcollateralized loans against your deposited btc. Currently have the best USDC interest rates. They primarily (exclusively?) lend their assets to Genesis Capital. Lots of useful discussion [here](https://twitter.com/danheld/status/1334152341881311234?s=20).

[Voyager](https://voyager.onelink.me/WNly/referral?af_sub5=KEIECB): $1.1b under management as of Feb 2021. Interest rates similar to BlockFi but no consumer lending; they only lend to major market players (Galaxy Digital, BitGo/Goldman Sachs, Jump Capital). A lot (most?) of their revenue comes from price spreads on their trading platform. Publicly traded in Canada (read: extra level of regulation and scrutiny. Good).

This [interview with CEO Steve Ehrlich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w_XVpRLI_A&t=3s) is good, but the interviewer doesn't know enough about the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem to ask any hard questions.

[Abra](https://abra.com): Smaller player but like the others moving towards being a completely crypto-backed bank account. Deposit your USD, earn interest on it as a stablecoin, spend it as needed via debit card, convert as much as you like to bitcoin and then earn interest on that.

Pomp's [interview with CEO Bill Barhydt](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bill-barhydt-founder-ceo-abra-bitcoin-future-asset/id1434060078?i=1000457327798) is excellent.


### Bitcoin "cashback" cards & incentive programs
[Fold App](https://use.foldapp.com/r/9PH3CUKE): Buy gift cards for popular retailers and earn "sats back". A debit card with much better bonuses (e.g. 5% sats back on Amazon purchases) is slowly being rolled out to the waitlist.

[BlockFi credit card](https://blockfi.com/credit-card-waitlist/?r=6ZA0l): Zero fees, 1.5% btc rewards on all purchases. Bitcoin rewards automatically earn interest at BlockFi's variable monthly rate (5% APY as of May 2021).


### Bleeding Edge
Strike from Jack Mallers: Looks like a simple Cash App clone but is deeply integrated into the bitcoin and Lightning Network under the hood. Like Cash App you link your bank account and can instantly send USD to anyone else with Strike. But you can also pay a Lightning invoice without ever converting your USD. You can also send USD to a bitcoin address (even your own--think of it as an instant buy from your bank account to your bitcoin wallet); Strike converts your USD to bitcoin automatically. But you do pay the bitcoin network/miners' fee for the transaction.
