My list of recommended bitcoin education resources

### Podcasts
[What Bitcoin Did - Peter McCormack](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast):
[McCormack](https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack) is the best at playing the super-valuable "wait, I don't understand this" role for listeners who aren't technical and don't yet understand the complexities. All the major players in the bitcoin ecosystem end up on his show. Each new episode goes straight to the top of my queue.

[The Investors Podcast - Bitcoin Fundamentals (Preston Pysh)](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/):
This is a series within their unified podcast stream (their "We Study Billionaires" episodes are also a good listen). This is an excellent bridge for people who are already engaged in traditional markets. Be sure to follow [Preston](https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh) as well.

[Swan Signal](https://swansignalpodcast.com/):
Part of the education and marketing outreach for Swan Bitcoin. They put out excellent education content and have some of the strongest, most trusted bitcoiners on staff. Downside: each ep is just the audio from a live Zoom call so is often plagued by the typical glitches and cross-talk that happens on a livestream. Probably better to watch the [video version on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwanSignal).

[Stephan Livera Podcast](https://stephanlivera.com/):
Very technical but also focused on Austrian economics. Pick and choose the episodes that fit your interest/tech level.


### YouTube
[Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWCJCWOxBYSi5DhCieLOLQ): The absolute best at providing the sweeping, broad vision for how bitcoin can change the world for the better. If you want the big picture, his talks are phenomenal. But as much as I love him, I don't think he's quite right for beginners; you need a little more foundation before you can understand his inspiring extrapolations. Note that his Q&A vids can be super-technical.

### Bitcoin books
[Layered Money (Nik Bhatia)](https://www.amazon.com/Layered-Money-Dollars-Bitcoin-Currencies/dp/1736110527): A quick, efficient read that establishes a powerful "layers" metaphor for money that starts from an epoch of gold coin-based economy on up to the present day and beyond. This is currently my go-to book to refer to people who want to understand why bitcoin has any value.

To understand the possible significance of bitcoin you have to understand how many layers of money--and risk--sit between your US dollars and actual value. The primary focus here is to understand money first.

_The chapter on bitcoin is actually the weakest of the book. A bit too dry and too complex for someone totally new to bitcoin. There are better "what is bitcoin" explainers out there. Read the bitcoin chapter, but lean more heavily on other resources to get a better understanding of the basics._

[The Bitcoin Standard (Saifedean Ammous)](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861): A deeper dive into the history of money and how humanity has naturally selected the "best" form of money over time based on a variety of characteristics. Think of this as the advanced level course after Bhatia's quick introduction above. Saif's clear articulation of which properties a "good" money must have culminates in a strong endorsement of bitcoin as the best form of money we've ever seen.

_Saif indulges in some regrettable rants against fiat money--including a whole chapter where he claims that even art and food suffer in a fiat world--that I wish would have been edited out for being off-topic and more his opinion than anything I could see being rooted in fact or data. Unfortunately his overall goal is not to persuade the skeptical reader who is used to the fiat money world; he is more likely to ridicule and punish fiat defenders. I wish he would have taken a more welcoming approach but his anger and confrontational nature win out. And, as with Bhatia, I think his chapter on bitcoin towards the end is quite uninteresting and, to be honest, I can't recall if I even finished the book. He made the case in the 2/3rds of the book that analyze previous forms of money; the bitocin parts weren't telling me anything I didn't already know._


### Exchanges
Cash App: Makes the most sense for someone that just wants to dabble once or twice with buying bitcoin. Fees are not great but it's fine if you're just playing. You can transfer the btc you buy out of Cash App and into a wallet that you control. This is an important difference between other similar services that don't allow you to withdraw (Robinhood, PayPal). Cash App pays the bitcoin network/miners' fees on your withdrawals. You can also use Cash App as a simple wallet to recieve bitcoin, though in the long run there are much better options.

Swan Bitcoin: By far the best option for casual investors who want to automate as much as possible. Link your bank account and set an investment schedule (e.g. $10 every week) and it'll automatically do the buys for you. Fees depend on amount purchased per week, ranging from 1.19% to 2.29%. And because Swan is built by true bitcoiners, they encourage you to get your btc off of their platform. You can provide them with a receive address and set up autowithdrawals. They pay the bitcoin network fee on the withdrawal. You then have complete set-it-and-forget-it bitcoin buys that land safely in a wallet that you control!

Coinbase Pro: For more serious investors moving larger sums of money. At this level you need to really minimize fees and avoid the price spreads that the other services tack on to the price. Register a regular Coinbase account and then login at the pro.coinbase.com to access their Pro UI. Trading on Coinbase Pro drops your total fees to just a 0.35% flat fee (one $100 tx carries the same 35Â¢ fee as twenty $5 txs). Can do instant buys from your linked checking account with no additional fee up to $5k. Incoming wire transfers add a $10 fee. The UI is overwhelming and chaotic. All you need are market buys/sells. Withdrawals are charged to you but they do bulk transactions so total fee is much lower than you'd pay for moving some bitcoin yourself.

Paxos / itBit: Lowest possible fees. If you set a "post only" limit order, you get a tiny 0.03% credit (i.e. they pay you a commission rather than you paying them a tx fee). Built to cater to larger institutions so ACH transfers aren't encouraged (limited to $500/wk and have a crappy 1% fee). Incoming wire transfers have no fee and no limits. You pay a share of the bitcoin network/miners' fee to withdraw your btc.


### Bitcoin "wallets"
"Wallets" is a misnomer; they're really more like storehouses for your bitcoin private keys (which you can sort of think of as the password for your bitcoin funds).

BlueWallet: This is where I start all beginners. It's an open-source software wallet that lives on your phone or desktop app. Not the most secure option but is good enough and is better than leaving your coins on an exchange. see my [step-by-step beginner's guide](https://github.com/kdmukai/bitcoin_gift_guide/).

Hardware wallets:
(this list is not exhaustive)
* Trezor
* Ledger
* Coldcard
* KeepKey
* Blockstream Jade
* various DIY projects: Specter DIY, SeedSigner


### Bleeding Edge
Strike from Jack Mallers: Looks like a simple Cash App clone but is deeply integrated into the bitcoin and Lightning Network under the hood. Like Cash App you link your bank account and can instantly send USD to anyone else with Strike. But you can also pay a Lightning invoice without ever converting your USD. You can also send USD to a bitcoin address (even your own--think of it as an instant buy from your bank account to your bitcoin wallet); Strike converts your USD to bitcoin automatically. But you do pay the bitcoin network/miners' fee for the transaction.
