# What about Ethereum and all the other altcoins?

## Understand the basics
Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain, EOS/WAX, and many others are competing to be permissionless, distributed computing platforms. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) with less centralization.

Bitcoin and some other altcoins--Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc--are focusing on being a currency and/or a store of value.

These are two enormously different spaces. Different value propositions. Different end games.

### Where are the computing platforms going?
There are immense, fascinating possibilities with these computing platforms. "Smart contracts" can wipe out financial middlemen like escrow agents (if Party A satisfies conditions X,Y,Z transfer the value that Party B deposited to Party A, otherwise refund Party B). Tokenization of assets and ownership (why pay TicketMaster's fees to maintain their own proprietary network when concert tickets can just be issued on a public blockchain?).

As more and more use cases arise, these blockchain-based computing platforms will become more and more important and will absolutely displace tons of industries.

#### But first a present-day analog
AWS is the king of the (non-blockchain) cloud computing space and represents a larger and larger majority of Amazon's annual revenue. But every year Microsoft's Azure platform eats away at AWS' market share. Google Cloud Platform is similarly trying to get a bigger slice of the pie. Smaller services like Heroku, LunaNode, etc are trying to find their niche.

Over time we should expect AWS' dominance to bleed away while simultaneously its profitability will asymptote lower and lower. Competition will make cloud computing a [commodity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp): _"a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable... The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers."_

In other words, in the near future tech companies won't care if they're running on AWS or Azure or whatever. Any of them will get the job done and they'll all have to be competitive on price, product offering, and reliability.

#### And so commoditization goes for crypto, too
Ethereum is by far the most popular platform but tons of other projects have already modified themselves to be able to run Ethereum smart contracts. So developers and companies have almost zero switching costs.

So, yes, these smart contract platforms _are the future_. But it doesn't make sense to me to place a bet on one as being the new future king. These kinds of computing services are a commodity. Period. There is no exclusivity where one platform can do something that the others can't. All the platforms will evolve and co-opt their competitors' best features.

#### Profitable investment = problematic service
The investment thesis itself seems flawed for another reason: cost. You pay for AWS services with USD. But imagine if you had to pay for them in $AMZN stock? The more powerful and popular AWS gets, the more valuable $AMZN stock will get. If you, in this theoretical example, had to pay in $AMZN stock, AWS services would then become unsustainably expensive. It's a kind of success death spiral.

This is Ethereum and all the other crypto computing platforms. You pay for computing services by spending (or "staking"--aka buying and then "locking up") the platform's currency. It costs $ETH to run Ethereum smart contracts.

If Ethereum continues its wild success and $ETH keeps growing in value--as all the Ethereum investors of course hope will happen--the cost of computing on Ethereum will keep rising. This is [already happening during moments of high usage](https://www.coindesk.com/high-gas-fees-prevent-ethereum-from-being-ethereum) where the price of an operation far exceeds its value.


### Where are the currency/store of value cryptos going?
This is a broader topic that requires diving into what a currency is that is way beyond the scope of this brief and beyond my abilities to adequately articulate.

#### There is no P/E ratio
My basic thesis is that a currency/store of value is nothing like a stock or any of the crypto computing platform tokens. Anything based on revenue or utility has some real-world value that analysts can try to suss out. If the price exceeds that estimate, either the analysts were wrong or it's overheated and will come back to a reasonable valuation.

But a good currency/store of value is capable of absorbing as much wealth as people care to inject into it. There is no maximum size for a black hole. Throw a planet in, it gets bigger. Throw a star in, it gets bigger. If it collides with another black hole, they eat each other, merge, and become bigger.

If the world decides to store more and more of its wealth in bitcoin, there's no value metric that says that it's now too big. There's no limit to how much a black hole can eat. There's no limit to how much wealth bitcoin can store.

#### So what about competing new digital currencies?
Will other digital currency projects become more enticing than bitcoin? It's certainly possible. But there are network effects associated with a successful currency. How much wealth has it already accrued, how many companies are deeply integrated into it, how much intellect and skill is devoted to it, how much regulatory framework, etc, etc.

The deeper the ecosystem, the harder a currency is to unseat.

A competing digital currency may have certain advantages over bitcoin, newer and more exciting innovations (e.g. private transactions on Monero). But unless that competing currency can chip away at the massive network effects of the incumbent, those exciting bells and whistles won't carry it very far.

And let's not forget that bitcoin itself is still innovating (albeit at a very prudent, seemingly glacial pace).

## How to view altcoin valuations
Crypto investors love to tout when an altcoin hits a new all-time high. But notice that they almost always denominate it against USD. The real metric is to look at the altcoin-to-bitcoin pairing (e.g. ETH/BTC). This is literally your opportunity cost for putting value in the altcoin instead of bitcoin.

Ethereum may have hit an all-time of $2100 but it's simultaneously trading at a bitcoin-denominated value of 0.035 btc. Ethereum's all-time high against bitcoin is somewhere around 0.124 btc. So today's "all-time high" is more a reflection of bitcoin's _growing_ value and Ethereum's _shrinking_ value against bitcoin.

The denomination matters.

Altcoin price movements are dominated by bitcoin price swings. Celebrating a 5% pump in an altcoin on a day when bitcoin pumps 10% is not a victory. Check the btc-denominated price and you'll realize that all you did was lose ground.
