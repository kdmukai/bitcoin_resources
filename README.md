My list of recommended bitcoin education resources

### Podcasts
[What Bitcoin Did - Peter McCormack](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast):
[McCormack](https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack) is the best at playing the super-valuable "wait, I don't understand this" role for listeners who aren't technical and don't yet understand the complexities. All the major players in the bitcoin ecosystem end up on his show. Each new episode goes straight to the top of my queue.

[The Investors Podcast - Bitcoin Fundamentals (Preston Pysh)](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/):
This is a series within their unified podcast stream (their "We Study Billionaires" episodes are also a good listen). This is an excellent bridge for people who are already engaged in traditional markets. Be sure to follow [Preston](https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh) as well.

[Swan Signal](https://swansignalpodcast.com/):
Part of the education and marketing outreach for Swan Bitcoin. They put out excellent education content and have some of the strongest, most trusted bitcoiners on staff. Downside: each ep is just the audio from a live Zoom call so is often plagued by the typical glitches and cross-talk that happens on a livestream. Probably better to watch the [video version on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwanSignal).

[Stephan Livera Podcast](https://stephanlivera.com/):
Very technical but also focused on Austrian economics. Pick and choose the episodes that fit your interest/tech level.
