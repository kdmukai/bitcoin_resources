# What about Ethereum and all the other altcoins?

## Understand the basics
Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Smart Chain, EOS/WAX, and many others are competing to be permissionless, distributed computing platforms. Think Amazon Web Services (AWS) with less centralization.

And then running on top of these platforms (or eventually spinning up their own blockchain) are various "utility tokens" that use their token to pay for more niche services within their ecosystem (e.g. FileCoin for paying for decentralized file storage).

Meanwhile Bitcoin and some other altcoins--Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, etc--are focusing on being a currency and/or a store of value.

These are enormously different spaces. Different value propositions. Different end games.

### Where are the computing platforms going?
There are immense, fascinating possibilities with these computing platforms. "Smart contracts" can wipe out financial middlemen like escrow agents (if Party A satisfies conditions X,Y,Z, transfer the value that Party B deposited to Party A, otherwise refund Party B). Tokenization of assets and ownership will become the norm (why pay TicketMaster's fees to maintain their own proprietary network when concert tickets can just be issued on a public blockchain?).

As more and more use cases arise, these blockchain-based computing platforms will become more and more important and will absolutely displace tons of industries.

#### But first a present-day analog
AWS is the king of the (non-blockchain) cloud computing space and represents a larger and larger majority of Amazon's annual revenue. But every year Microsoft's Azure platform eats away at AWS' market share. Google Cloud Platform is similarly trying to get a bigger slice of the pie. Smaller services like Heroku, LunaNode, etc are trying to find their niche.

Over time we should expect AWS' dominance to bleed away while simultaneously its profitability will asymptote lower and lower. Competition will make cloud computing a [commodity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity.asp): _"a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable... The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers."_

In other words, in the near future tech companies won't care if they're running on AWS or Azure or whatever. Any of them will get the job done and they'll all have to be competitive on price, product offering, and reliability.

#### And so commoditization goes for crypto, too
Ethereum is by far the most popular platform but tons of other projects have already modified themselves to be able to run Ethereum smart contracts. So developers and companies have almost zero switching costs.

So, yes, these smart contract platforms _are the future_. But it doesn't make sense to me to place a bet on one as being the new future king. These kinds of computing services are a commodity. Period. There is no exclusivity where one platform can do something that the others can't. All the platforms will evolve and co-opt their competitors' best features.

#### Profitable investment = problematic service
The investment thesis itself seems flawed for another reason: cost. You pay for AWS services with USD. But imagine if you had to pay for them in $AMZN stock? The more powerful and popular AWS gets, the more valuable $AMZN stock will get. If you, in this theoretical example, had to pay in $AMZN stock, AWS services would then become unsustainably expensive. There would be an upper limit to $AMZN's value that gets balanced against AWS' utility.

This is Ethereum and all the other crypto computing platforms. You pay for computing services by spending (or "staking"--aka buying and then "locking up") the platform's currency. It costs $ETH to run Ethereum smart contracts.

If Ethereum continues its wild success and $ETH keeps growing in value--as all the Ethereum investors of course hope will happen--the cost of computing on Ethereum will keep rising. This is [already happening during moments of high usage](https://www.coindesk.com/high-gas-fees-prevent-ethereum-from-being-ethereum) where the price of an operation far exceeds its value.


#### What about the utility tokens?
These are usually smart contracts running on top of one of the computing platforms that, as part of their smart contract code, create their own utility token that can be issued to users, traded, etc. These utility tokens are generally not their own blockchain; think of them more like applications running on Ethereum, BSC, etc. Some eventually do migrate to their own blockchain but this comes with other risks and tradeoffs.

A typical utility token is used as payment for some service that their side network provides. Need to store files? Render 3D models? Participate in a lending/margin/yield farming market? Even some exchanges (e.g. Binance, Huobi, KuCoin) have their own utility token that you can use to pay reduced trading fees and other bonuses.

The economic assumption is that as these sorts of services gain more widespread adoption and more usage, the value of the side network will grow and, as a result, the utility token will gain in value.

This is an even heavier lift than the computing platforms as it's a bet on a niche service that may or may not find a market fit. At least the computing platforms can keep creating new types of smart contracts and use cases (e.g. NFTs, yield farming, etc; every couple of months there's a new trend). But what if, say, decentralized 3D rendering never takes off? Or what if it's just too early?

And these services would seem to face the same price plateau/commoditization challenges that the computing platforms face. At some level of success the cost of spending the utility token outweighs the value of the service being provided. And there's always incentive for competitors to enter and drive value down to break-even commodity levels.

Utility tokens that exist on an existing computing platform are vulnerable to the same high fee problems that plague $ETH and whichever ones come next. A new, unproven utility token niche service can be priced out of its market simply due to the cost of running on its parent computing platform.

But utility tokens that run their own blockchain run the insanely high risk of writing their own code that might contain bugs which compromise the whole system. A small team or company simply cannot hope to produce the same robust, bulletproof code that drive the largest platforms. Nascent blockchains with low adoption also have so few participants that it would be easy to overwhelm it with malicious miners that rewrite the data to steal funds (aka "51% attack").

They also tend to be very illiquid--meaning that hardly anyone is trading them. That means it doesn't take much effort to manipulate the market. These small projects are rife with pump and dump schemes.

The biggest problem though is that most utility tokens simply do not need to exist. The parent smart contract platforms can already perform whatever service the utility token purports to oversee; why should you have to pay in $XYZ coin for a smart contract that can run on $ETH or $BSC or whatever anyway? The 2017 ICO craze was dominated by nonsense utility tokens that just ran on Ethereum and added no additional value. The vast, vast majority were just money grabs wrapped up in marketing BS.

The rise of bitcoin's Lightning Network further complicates the value proposition of these utility tokens. If I can stream tiny fractional amounts of bitcoin for nearly zero cost, why do I need a separate utility token economy to pay for a service? 


### Where are the currency/store of value cryptos going?
This is a broader topic that requires diving into what a currency is that is way beyond the scope of this brief and beyond my abilities to adequately articulate.

#### There is no P/E ratio
My basic thesis is that a currency/store of value is nothing like a stock or any of the crypto computing platform tokens. Anything based on revenue or utility has some real-world value that analysts can try to suss out. If the price exceeds that estimate, either the analysts were wrong or it's overheated and will come back to a reasonable valuation.

But a good currency/store of value is capable of absorbing as much wealth as people care to inject into it. There is no maximum size for a black hole. Throw a planet in, it gets bigger. Throw a star in, it gets bigger. If it collides with another black hole, they eat each other, merge, and become bigger.

If the world decides to store more and more of its wealth in bitcoin, there's no value metric that says that it's now too big. There's no limit to how much a black hole can eat. There's no limit to how much wealth bitcoin can store.

#### So what about competing new digital currencies?
Will other digital currency projects become more enticing than bitcoin? It's certainly possible. But there are network effects associated with a successful currency. How much wealth has it already accrued, how many companies are deeply integrated into it, how much intellect and skill is devoted to it, how much regulatory framework, etc, etc.

The deeper the ecosystem, the harder a currency is to unseat.

A competing digital currency may have certain advantages over bitcoin, newer and more exciting innovations (e.g. private transactions on Monero). But unless that competing currency can chip away at the massive network effects of the incumbent, those exciting bells and whistles won't carry it very far.

And let's not forget that bitcoin itself is still innovating (albeit at a very prudent, seemingly glacial pace).


## How to view altcoin valuations
Crypto investors love to tout when an altcoin hits a new all-time high. But notice that they almost always denominate it against USD. The real metric is to look at the altcoin-to-bitcoin pairing (e.g. ETH/BTC instead of ETH/USD). This is literally your opportunity cost for putting value in the altcoin instead of bitcoin.

Ethereum may have hit an all-time of $2100 but it's simultaneously trading at a bitcoin-denominated value of 0.035 btc. Ethereum's all-time high against bitcoin is somewhere around 0.124 btc. So today's "all-time high" is more a reflection of bitcoin's _growing_ USD value and Ethereum's _shrinking_ value against bitcoin.

The denomination matters.

Altcoin price movements are dominated by bitcoin price swings. Celebrating a 5% pump in an altcoin on a day when bitcoin pumps 10% is not a victory. Check the btc-denominated price and you'll realize that all you did was lose ground. 


## Beware: Most altcoins are garbage
I think we will see a few computing platform/utility token winners eventually emerge but, as discussed above, I think they will settle into a flat commodity-level service.

But the vast, VAST majority will never achieve any kind of actual usage or adoption. And that's assuming that the project is even making a good-faith effort at building their technology. From the outside--especially if you aren't technical--it's almost impossible to tell which projects are legit and which are just blowing smoke as a money grab.

This is a dangerous space full of scam artists. Beware social media influencers who hype various projects. Many of them are paid to shill for the project and the majority of the people on social media don't even understand the tech to begin with. They may be fast and impressive with the jargon and buzzwords but just saying "it's the first truly byzantine fault tolerant platform!" doesn't mean they really know what that means or that they have the expertise to really vet the claims.


## The best project doesn't always win
But let's say that you do find some truly reliable, expert people who are all genuinely excited about a project. It has real tech innovations, the right team behind it, and really should be viewed as light years ahead of its competing platforms. This is THE clear-cut winner, right?

And then Elon Musk tweets about one of its competitors. Because he was bored. And because he liked their funny mascot.

Oops, sorry, now the social media feeding frenzy puts all its energy there. Your gem project which really should be the winner gets ignored. The garbage project that doesn't deserve the hype leaps ahead.

Maybe in the long run the market corrects itself and the best projects inevitably push their way to the top.

But at this early stage every project, regardless of its merits, relies on hype, publicity, buzz.

Fine, so maybe just go with what's trendy? Egads. What a disaster. Bribed shillers and uninformed noobs jumping on a momentum train that might be a total scam? Stay away.


## It's your call
There IS a crap-ton of money to be made by speculating in altcoins. But it takes a combination of immense skill, immense luck, and (let's be honest) flat-out insider trading.

Dive into these shark-infested, piranha-infested, leech-infested waters if you like. Just realize that all the odds are heavily stacked against you. You might be smarter than the average trader, but that won't help you when a secret insiders' group coordinates a dump on your otherwise perfectly played investment. These are much thinner markets that are much easier to manipulate. The founding teams themselves are usually sitting on the lion's share of the tokens (google "premine") and can exit scam and crash the price while you're sleeping.

I don't begrudge anyone who succeeds at speculating in this wild west. But I absolutely DO NOT recommend it. You are the mark. You are the patsy.
